## Project Name: New York City Taxi Fare Prediction

### Problem Statement: predicting the fare amount (inclusive of tolls) for a taxi ride in New York City given the pickup and dropoff locations

Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client do or decide based on your analysis that they wouldn’t have done otherwise?
 - The client receives a fare estimate inclusive of tolls when they add the destination. The fare estimate plays a important role in deciding which ride hailing app the potential client might end up using. More accurate predicitions means happy customers.

Data science Hypothesis(es)/solutions considering: One or multiple angles to consider solving this problem with data science. This could be as many as 10+ questions for what you are considering to solve through analysis, visualizations, and machine learning

 1) Density of pickups & Drop offs
 2) Fare Amount predictions
