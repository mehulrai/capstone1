How do you create a data story? You’ve learned the basics, but the information is probably a bit abstract at this point. Keep in mind that storytelling is an art, so you have to get your imagination bubbling. In this project, you’ll learn some pointers to get those creative juices flowing. In the following sections, we’ll work step-by-step to create your first data story. 

Steps:
Ask the following questions and look for the answers using code and plots:
Can you count something interesting?
Can you find trends (e.g. high, low, increasing, decreasing, anomalies)?
Can you make a bar plot or a histogram?
Can you compare two related quantities?
Can you make a scatterplot?
Can you make a time-series plot?
Looking at the plots, what are some insights you can make? Do you see any correlations? Is there a hypothesis you’d like to investigate further? What other questions do the insights lead you to ask?
Now that you’ve asked questions, hopefully you’ve found some interesting insights. Is there a narrative or a way of presenting the insights using text and plots that tells a compelling story? What are some other trends/relationships you think will make the story more complete?
Submission: Submit links to a GitHub repository containing a Jupyter Notebook. The Notebook should contain:
The questions you asked
The trends you investigated
The resulting visualizations and conclusions
You will be evaluated using this rubric.

These results will go into your final portfolio and presentation. Organize your work as you go along to make it easier to compile later. Create slides and/or a presentation (.ppt) about your emerging data story.   
 
In case the dataset is too large to commit to GitHub, please include a link to the dataset inside the Jupyter Notebook.

Discuss these results with your mentor at the next call. if you’re having trouble with your code for this unit, you can reach out to your course TA for help by emailing projects@springboard.com, or post questions in the community forum.
